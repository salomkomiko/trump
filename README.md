# Diplomatic Disaster: Trump vs Zelensky

A fun arcade-style game where you play as President Zelensky defending against falling speech bubbles from Trump.

## Game Description

In "Diplomatic Disaster," you control President Zelensky and must shoot blue speech bubbles to counter the red speech bubbles dropping from Trump. The game features:

- A "Meltdown" bar that drains over time and when red bubbles hit you
- Dynamic scoring system with increasing multipliers
- Decreasing rewards over time (bubbles fill less of the meltdown bar as time passes)
- Increasing difficulty as you play (more bubbles, faster drops)
- Custom cartoon-style graphics with visual effects
- Simple controls

## Game Mechanics

- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game starts easy but quickly becomes challenging
- **Decreasing Rewards**: At the beginning, each bubble you destroy gives a lot of meltdown bar fill, but this decreases over time
- **Increasing Bubble Rate**: More bubbles will drop as time passes
- **Score System**: Earn points for each bubble destroyed, with a multiplier that increases over time
- **Visual Effects**: Particle explosions and score popups when bubbles are destroyed

## How to Play

1. Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move Zelensky
2. Press SPACE to shoot blue speech bubbles
3. Destroy red bubbles to fill the meltdown bar and earn points
4. Don't let the meltdown bar empty completely!
5. Try to get the highest score possible before Trump has a meltdown
